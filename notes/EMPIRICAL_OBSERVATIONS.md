# Empirical observations log (evidence-first: probe -> confidence -> prove)

Rule: keep Modal/local runs < 60s; stress-test each RED node AND the AMBER it flows
into; record every observation so the eventual conjecture is consistent with ALL data.
Only dispatch a Pro proof (10-25 min) once empirically confident. Confidence: LOW /
MEDIUM / HIGH / REFUTED.

## dli_prime_weighted_large_block_support  (deepest leaf)  — confidence: HIGH
Conjecture: the odd-eval residue partition puts o(L_j) mass on small (non-cancelling) blocks.
Observations (local, seconds):
- max_lambda |mu_hat_S| ~ 2.5/sqrt(|S|) for the odd-eval phase psi(lambda*P(sigma(y))).
  ROBUST across random AND structured (consecutive-index) subsets — no adversarial block
  cancels worse (section is mult-structured => additively spread). [P=x,x^3,x^5; n=16..256]
- Non-cancelling blocks are ONLY small ones: |S| <= ~C^2 ~ 9 (below the sqrt threshold).
- Near-peak FREQUENCY count VANISHES with scale: n=32 ~212 freqs |mu|>0.3; n=128: 0;
  n=256+: none |mu|>0.2. So near-peak mass DECREASES with scale (repo's "~129" is a
  small-scale artifact). max|mu| ~ 2.5/sqrt(n) throughout.
Not yet tested: the EXACT D-thread degree-preimage block partition (needs its definition);
the multi-level (per-L_j) weighting. Upstream amber (ejm->pcf->b2b): budget arithmetic
verified earlier (34 levels, sum L_j=t, o(t) closes at 2^122). 

## sov_gridsum_residual  — confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH
Conjecture: after paid trace-flat + quotient/dihedral + large_power_sum(Bohr) classes,
residual cells cancel (Lane-1). Equivalent test: small value-set => large power sum.
Observations (local + C, thousands of cells, 8 cell types incl arcs/APs/geometric/
cosets/sumsets/Bohr/random):
- CLEAN dichotomy: every small-value-set cell has max additive power-sum ratio >= 0.90;
  ZERO unexplained (small value-set + small power sums). Supports the decomposition.
- BUG caught in 2s: an incomplete-frequency check false-flagged APs (Bohr at freq d^-1) —
  fixed by sweeping all frequencies. (This was the wrong-conjecture failure mode in miniature.)
Not yet tested at scale on Modal (local signal already strong). Upstream amber
(single_obstruction_valueset via sov_hminus1_fiber_fourier_duality) not yet stress-tested.

## petal (Gate D / petal_quotient_descent_step)  — confidence: LOW (needs redesign)
Conjecture: power-sum window m >= theta*2^r => coset-union at scale r; theta=5.
Observations (L1 dyadic toy F_17[z]/(z^32-3), |H|=512):
- Coset-unions at scale r have window exactly 2^{r+1}-1 = 2*2^r - 1, well BELOW theta*2^r=5*2^r
  => theta=5 is conservative (~2.5x margin above a bare scale-r coset-union).
- Random supports essentially NEVER have a power-sum window (p_1=0 is codim-32) => windows
  are rare/structured, consistent with Gate N.
Flaw in first design: tested the wrong direction; need to CONSTRUCT long-window non-coset
supports to measure the tight theta. Redesign pending.

## m720_conductor_compression (the gate: no primitive non-toral survivor) — confidence: MEDIUM (test vacuous)
Observations (local, exhaustive small n): random anchored 2h-supports over char-0 (aux prime
P0=1e9) have ZERO char-0 survivors (all obstructions O_j!=0) at n=8,16 / h=3,4. So the gate
holds GENERICALLY (random supports never survive). BUT the test is VACUOUS for the real
question: it found no survivors at all, so cannot classify the STRUCTURED (X79 square-shift)
survivors as toral vs primitive. Need the exact square-shift survivor family to stress-test
the X24 char-0-toral classification. My O_j setup (S_R^2-C_R, top-h match) may not capture the
actual survivor condition. Prior modal_m720 census: 0 survivors where complete (consistent).
CAVEAT to record: no strong empirical handle on the PRIMITIVE-survivor exclusion yet.

## sov upstream amber single_obstruction_valueset (grid-sum => small fibers) — confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH
Observation: in the sov_adv census, NON-structured (random) cells have value-set fraction
vf ~ 1.0 (O takes ~all field values => small fibers), while only the additively-structured
(Bohr) cells have small vf. So after removing the Bohr/large_power_sum class, residual cells
DO have (1-o(1))q value-set. Supports the amber (single_obstruction_valueset) for residual
cells. Not yet tested: the exact Fourier-duality constant / anchored-cell version.

## corridor_ledger / adjacency_closing (clean-rate corridors) — confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (computed)
STRESS-TEST of the amber (and correction of my own stale strategic claim):
- fourth_mechanism_rate8 is legitimately PROVED (gate:any on cap_end_sharpening, PROVED):
  the quotient-remainder floor at c=2^28 delivers 0.0625 grid steps = 8.8x the 0.00707 wedge.
  Its statement.md said "TARGET" — STALE; dag.json PROVED is justified. (Fixed the .md.)
- Acl anchors VERIFIED exactly: Acl_tot=(3^{N'/2}+1)/2, log2 = 49.72/100.44/201.88 for
  N'=64/128/256 (rho=1/2 antipodal class count). Arithmetic sound.
- Rate-1/8 eater ledger delivers +0.0164 (acl) +0.099 (window) +0 (ext guard) +0.0625 (cap_end)
  = 0.178 grid steps; corridor row CLOSES at the computed level.
=> CORRECTION: the "rate-1/8 ~0.9-bit wedge" I proposed as the top target is ALREADY CLOSED.
   The clean-rate (1/4,1/8,1/16) corridors close (corridor_ledger PROVED, computed/verifier level).
   The ONLY remaining adjacency blocker is rate_half (rate 1/2, bracket-grade).
CAVEAT: the eaters are "COMPUTED (agent verifier PASS)" — arithmetically verified here, but the
rigorous-proof vs high-confidence-computation status is the general fidelity question, not re-audited.
Strategic update: remaining prize gaps = (a) the 8 mca_safe leaves, (b) rate_half adjacency (rate 1/2).

## dli REAL-OBJECT CORRECTION (supersedes the proxy evidence above) — confidence: MEDIUM (was HIGH)
- Block partition PINNED: B_j(M)=q^{-L_j} sum_lambda prod_y mu_hat_y(lambda), mu_hat_y(lambda)=sum_d psi(d lambda v_y),
  v_y=zeta_n^{(2s+1)i}. CONFIRMED by verify_level2_tower.py (TEST 1 = exact mu_32 census match).
- My earlier max|mu_hat|~2.5/sqrt(n) was the WHOLE-SECTION average = a PROXY, NOT prod_y mu_hat_y. Superseded.
- Real excess rho=skewcount*q/2^|G| SCALES WITH q; eta_j=log_q rho_j. VANDERMONDE: nonzero skew needs support
  >= L_j+1, so meaningful regime is LARGE support (my |G|=3-6 test = below-threshold toy artifacts).
- Calibration eta*/L=3.6e-7 => eta_j=3.6e-7 L_j (linear, tiny coeff): Sum_j eta_j=3.6e-7 t=o(t) via the SMALL
  COEFFICIENT, not bounded excess. This is the correct hypothesis shape.
- NEXT TEST: reproduce eta_j = log_q(B_j/balanced_mean) at the actual calibration params (need the U_j/balanced
  normalization + the level structure), confirm eta_j/L_j ~ 3.6e-7 and characterize which profiles are the sup.
- Task (b) chain-tangle: dli subtree ~15 nodes, two Deligne branches converge on ejm; reduced_phase_manifest
  statement stale (Deligne route) but is one node in the tangle; full reconciliation pending a careful trace.

## dli REAL-OBJECT CONFIRMATION (resolves the correction above) — confidence: HIGH (on the true object)
Using the Fourier form (rho_j = sum_{lam in F_p^L} prod_y (1/|D|) sum_u psi(a_y u)) — the REAL object, reaching
large N without 3^N enumeration:
- eta* = log_q rho_j is FLAT: rho_j -> 1.0000 (eta* -> 0) as N grows, BOTH ternary and signed. [n=32..256, N up to 128]
- CALIBRATION REPRODUCED: signed midpoint eta*=0.019 at mu_32,N=16 (EXACT match to dli_dirichlet_log_integral
  record); decreasing with N. ternary flat ~0. This is the node's own calibration, replayed on the real object.
=> Sum_j eta_j = o(t) holds; the leaf is CORRECT as stated. The earlier proxy reached the right conclusion by the
   wrong route; the real-object test confirms it properly. dli is now empirically PROMOTION-READY (HIGH).
Small-N artifacts noted: at large-p/small-N, B collapses to the trivial vector (expected count <<1) giving
spurious large rho -- NOT the meaningful regime. The Fourier form at large N is the correct test.

## dli CHAIN RECONCILIATION (task b) — OUTCOME: chain is SOUND (spot-check + endpoint)
Full upward trace: the leaf reaches ejm through ONE connected chain (~17 nodes); the two
"branches" (polar_obstruction / pole_majorant) RECONVERGE at odd_phase_reduced_pole_budget.
Spot-check of the 3 critical joints:
- reduced_phase_manifest: reqs = {phase_pole_conductor_manifest [PROVED], harmonic_conductor_ledger
  [weakened]}. CONSISTENT = proved Deligne pole + weakened harmonic total. NOT stale (my earlier read
  was wrong: the pole parts are PROVED, only the harmonic-sum part is the weakened open route).
- odd_phase_reduced_pole_budget: needs "not AS-trivial" + "polar divisor harmonic total o(t)" -- the
  SAME o(t) threading back to harmonic_conductor_ledger -> bohr -> block_conductor -> leaf.
- dli_dirichlet_log_integral: the geometric-mean DLI, fed by the chain.
ENDPOINT CHECK: my calibration measured rho_j = sum_lambda F_M(lambda) DIRECTLY = the pcf/b2b endpoint;
it is flat. So the leaf's flatness gives the ejm/pcf input at the endpoint regardless of the Deligne
detour. Wired path and direct measurement AGREE.
=> A proved leaf propagates cleanly to ejm. No rewiring/hacking needed.
CAVEAT: spot-check of 3 joints + endpoint, NOT a full 17-node per-implication audit. The one residual
item worth a Pro glance: confirm the T3 "near-peak mass / harmonic total o(t)" output EXACTLY matches
the Deligne route's "reduced polar divisor harmonic total o(t)" input (same quantity, different language).

## dli PRO CONDITIONAL CLOSURE (DLI-FLATNESS) — exact reduction PROVED, leaf = RES count
- Lemma 1 (PROVED, orthogonality, VERIFIED): rho_j(M) = q^{L_j} |Z_j(M)| / U_j, Z_j = kernel skews
  {d in prod D_y : A d = 0}. |Z_j|=81(ternary)/16(signed) match the harness B exactly. So dli-flatness
  is EXACTLY a kernel-skew count.
- Remaining leaf (RES): |R_j(M)| + 1_{0} <= q^{kappa_j} U_j/q^{L_j}, sum kappa_j=o(t); R_j (proved to
  contain Z_j\{0}) = large-support(>=L_j+1) + norm-gated + not killed-cyclotomic. A sharp COUNTING stmt.
- ZERO-ATOM (verified): unconditional-A FALSE if singleton-zero domains allowed (rho_j=q^{L_j}). Fix =
  RANK CHARGING (zero atoms cost L_j - rank; central measure must exclude/charge them).
- FIXED-LAMBDA refuted (|F_M|<=1): obstruction is aggregate kernel-skew mass, not any single lambda.
- Empirical eta* flat (rho_j->1) = RES with kappa_j ~ 0 already supported. Remaining = the rigorous
  RES/resultant-sieve count. dli confidence HIGH; exact reduction now PROVEN.

## dli MAJOR CORRECTION (supersedes the HIGH-confidence + "phrasing artifact" entries above)
Pro's SHARPER counterexample (verified): a low-mass profile with L active ternary coords + rest zero
has U_j=3^L, |Z_j|=1 (Vandermonde), so rho_j=(q/3)^L => log_q rho_j ~ 0.994 L_j = Omega(L_j). This is
FORCED BY MASS (log_q U_j=0.006 L_j << L_j), independent of resultants. NOT the trivial {0} case; the
active-coord/full-rank scoping does NOT exclude it. So:
- The SUP obligation (my brief) is FALSE. It was only a SUFFICIENT condition for the b2b U-WEIGHTED
  AVERAGE of prod_j rho_j = q^{o(t)}; sup false => that route is DEAD.
- The real obligation = the weighted average directly (low-mass profiles U-suppressed by q^{1.58L} but
  number C(256L,L); whether suppression beats count is the OPEN primitive-core content).
- My eta*-flat calibration ONLY tested the FULL-MASS profile => HIGH confidence was OVERSTATED.
- Lemma 1 (exact reduction rho_j=q^{L_j}|Z_j|/U_j) still holds.
LESSON: the calibration was necessary but not sufficient -- it covered one profile family, not the sup/
weighted-average over ALL profiles. Adversarial Pro pressure caught the overclaim. This is the
"leaf-is-incorrect -> reassess" scenario. REASSESSMENT NEEDED: does pcf/ejm/b2b use the per-profile
sup (broken) or the weighted average (correct)? The chain must be re-checked against the weighted-average form.

## sov WORST-CASE CENSUS (dli-lesson-corrected) — MECHANISM SURVIVES (opposite of dli)
Modal thorough run (1064 cells, primes to 32003, 9 families incl. DEGENERATE small-support + subgroup-confined):
- value-set measured RELATIVE TO ACHIEVABLE MASS min(C(m,h),p) -- the dli-lesson fix (distinguishes genuine
  COLLISIONS from mass-deficiency). 950 mass-sufficient cells.
- 521 collision-heavy cells (vf<0.6 rel. mass); of those 521/521 = 100% Bohr-caught (maxpow>=0.15). ZERO
  counterexamples (no small-value-set cell evades the Bohr paid class), including the degenerate families that
  are the analog of the low-mass profile that KILLED dli.
=> sov's CORE MECHANISM (genuine collision => Bohr-detectable => paid) survives a worst-case adversarial census.
   Strong positive evidence, the OPPOSITE of the dli outcome.
CAVEATS (dli lesson: don't over-generalize the census): (1) tests the collision=>Bohr MECHANISM, not the FULL
obligation (quotient/dihedral exhaustion + the Lane-1 power-sum residual bound + the exact anchored-core
quantifier); (2) moderate primes (structural claim, scale-invariant, but not prize-scale); (3) maxpow has a
small-sample bias at tiny m (handled: REAL_CE category is mass-sufficient where maxpow is reliable).
CONFIDENCE: mechanism HIGH; full sov leaf MEDIUM-HIGH (untested parts remain).

## sov LANE-1 RESIDUAL probe (quantitative, dli-lesson-applied) — Lane-1 ROBUST; pricing crux identified
Quantitative (B=maxpow, value-set deficit) census + a gap probe (diluted-Bohr cells, Bohr fraction 0..1):
- 0 Lane-1 violations across 328 mass-sufficient cells. Fourier-uniform cells have deficit~0 (FULL value-set).
- Sharp transition: deficit~0 up to B~0.93; only PURE Bohr/interval (B->1) collapses (deficit 0.99). A 10%
  random admixture already rescues the value-set. So the Bohr class that TRULY collapses is very narrow.
- KEY SUBTLETY for the pricing obligation: a cell can have high char-sum B AND full value-set (random part
  rescues). The Bohr GATE (B>threshold) thus OVER-includes cells Lane-1 would close. Threshold placement:
  low => Bohr class large/expensive to price; near B=1 => narrow/cheap, BUT only if the Euler-product bound
  is TIGHT enough to close cells up to B~1. Empirically deficit=0 up to B~0.93.
  => THE CRUX of the pricing obligation = tightness of the Lane-1 Euler-product bound near B=1 (the gap between
     "Lane-1 proves closure" and "Bohr gate must price"). This is the sharp question for a Pro round / proof.
- CONFIDENCE: Lane-1 Euler-product theorem empirically ROBUST (stress-tested, survives). The open pricing
  obligation is well-characterized (narrow Bohr class) but its difficulty hinges on the bound's tightness.
  Moderate primes (structural). Overall sov: mechanism HIGH, Lane-1 HIGH, pricing obligation OPEN-but-narrowed.

## CODEX FALSIFICATION PASS (prize-rednode-falsification-20260705) — assessed + replayed 2026-07-05
Codex attacked all 8 leaves (numeric + algebraic, Modal <60s each). NONE deleted; all survive as TARGET.
CROSS-VALIDATION of my work: sov (0 falsifiers, remaining=Bohr pricing -- matches me exactly); dli (zero-atom/
rank falsifier reproduced; large-support scans FLATTEN -> positive for the weighted-average obligation).
CLEAN SURVIVORS (4): sov (Bohr pricing), rate_half (new mechanism, 2.98M gap, 0.1 vs 91.85 bits guardrail),
  e22 (source construction), m720 (survivor descent / D-GCD; shortcut 'h>=7 enough' killed).
PETAL CLUSTER = THE WEAK LINK (3 gates need repair):
  - Gate D (petal_quotient_descent_step): naive strategy FALSIFIED (verified witness M=36,p=37); scope/window/paid.
  - Gate L (petal_low_defect_quotient_charge): CITATION GAP (charging without a paid citation; sheets grow); SOUNDNESS.
  - Gate N (petal_newton_window): SCOPE GAP (no definition/verifier; naive shortcut refuted).
The petal gates feed BOTH list_grand AND (via the pole/list bridge) mca_safe -> the fragility touches both
grand challenges. Gate L's citation gap is the most concerning (a charged-but-uncited class = latent soundness hole).

## Gate L CITATION-GAP TRACE (petal_low_defect_quotient_charge) — bridgeable, SHARED ROOT with Gates N & D
- Gate L asserts low-defect quotient sheets are PAID; consumer PRK_pet peels them assuming paid; NO node justifies it.
- VERIFIED: the sheets = EXACTLY C(M,delta) (choices of the delta removed points B): 560=C(16,3), 4960=C(32,3),
  41664=C(64,3), 341376=C(128,3). So poly(n)-MANY structured quotient-coordinate families (fixed defect delta<=theta-1)
  -- exactly the TYPE petal_fixed_excess (poly count at fixed excess) handles. NOT unbounded.
- The gap = no node PROVES the C(M,delta) sheets are a paid class. TWO missing links:
  (a) defect delta <-> excess e=d-ell (reparametrization to fixed_excess);
  (b) quotient-coordinate <-> ambient full-petal coordinate.
- LINK (b) IS THE SAME primitive-coordinate bridge Gate N needs (naive K-membership shortcut refuted) and Gate D
  needs (D proof must visibly use the residue-kernel/primitive coordinate). => THE PETAL CLUSTER HAS A COMMON ROOT:
  one primitive/quotient-coordinate bridge would feed Gates L, N, D simultaneously. Highest-leverage petal move.
- Gate L is therefore NOT a dead soundness hole: it's bridgeable (poly(n) sheets), pending the shared coordinate bridge.

## Gate D STABILITY STRESS (petal_quotient_descent_step) — NOT yet stable; scoping is load-bearing + untested
C/Modal exhaustive MITM (M<=44): bare-mechanism counterexample window L*(M) [max window with a non-coarser,
non-antipodal, first-L-power-sums-zero subset]:
  M= 28 32 36 40 42 44  ->  L*= 4  4  5  6  6  5   (arithmetic-dependent; prime p matters strongly).
- L* EXCEEDS the toy theta=5 at M=40,42 (bare counterexamples at window 6). So NO small fixed window threshold
  makes the bare mechanism safe. (My first read of "unbounded ~M/logM" was an over-interpretation of 4 points;
  the Modal sweep shows fluctuation in 4-6, not clean growth -- corrected.)
- => Gate D's stability RESTS ENTIRELY on the squarefree-realizable scoping doing real work, which is UNVERIFIED
  and shares the primitive-coordinate definition gap with Gate N.
CONCLUSION (answers the "are red nodes stable before decomposing?" question for Gate D): NO, not yet. Do not
introduce a foundation node beneath the petal cluster until the squarefree-realizable scoping is pinned + tested.
The stress test did its job: it caught that Gate D's stability is contingent on an untested hypothesis.

## Gate D SCOPING VERIFIED (squarefree-realizable pinned + tested) — realizability caps the window
Pinned: squarefree-realizable = a split-squarefree kernel point of K_{I,d}=ker(pi_{>d} R_{I,d}) (executable).
Modal test + scaling:
- initial (t,ell<=4, d<=~11, q<=53): 2.05M candidates, 19211 realizable, max naive window = 3.
- scaled (t,ell<=6, d<=~20, q<=101): 1.36M candidates, 4276 realizable, max naive window = 2.
=> realizability FUNDAMENTALLY caps the naive-coordinate moment window at ~2-3 (does NOT grow with size). ZERO
   realizable points reach window>=5, vs arbitrary subsets where L*=5,6 exist. The bare Gate-D counterexamples
   are NOT realizable. The squarefree-realizable scoping is VERIFIED to do real work.
- So the workflow: bare mechanism UNSTABLE (L* stress) -> scoping VERIFIED to cap the window -> Gate D substantially
  more stable. This is the scoping earning its place, not assumed.
CAVEAT / REMAINING: naive root-coordinate window; Gate D's actual object is the QUOTIENT-coordinate window
Sum_x x^{Qt} (part 2, the primitive-coordinate definition). Confirm the cap holds there too before full confidence.

## PRIMITIVE COORDINATE — confirmed load-bearing + candidate definition (Gate N's core gap)
Modal test over realizable kernel points (K_{I,d} split-squarefree):
- naive (Q=1) moment window: capped at 2-3 (from prior test).
- MAX quotient-coordinate window (over x->x^Q): reaches 5. Witness: F_37, roots {4,5,10,12,17,29}, Q=6, window=5.
=> The primitive coordinate is REAL and load-bearing: the window small in the naive coordinate becomes large in a
   quotient coordinate. CANDIDATE DEFINITION: primitive coord = argmax_Q window(sum_x x^{Qt}). Window 5 > excess 1
   (consistent with Gate N ≥ c-kappa_N). This resolves the naive-vs-primitive contradiction Codex flagged.
- STATUS of the petal-cluster bottleneck: the coordinate is no longer a total unknown -- a concrete, testable
  candidate exists. REMAINING (Pro DEFINITION task): tie it to the petal/locator structure (vs generic x^Q) +
  verify the window grows with excess c across realizable families. This is a definition/proof task, not numerical.
STRESS-BEFORE-DECOMPOSE verdict: the shared coordinate is now empirically grounded (not vacuous, not undefined-in-
principle). Once the definition is tied to the petal structure + c-scaling verified, the petal cluster can be
decomposed on solid ground. Until then, do not add the foundation node.

## GATE N EXTRACTION REFUTED (Pro PETAL-PRIMITIVE-COORDINATE, verified) — petal descent broken
Pro answered Part A (canonical coordinate = petal quotient X->X^M + mu_M-character projectors Pi_{M,r}) but
REFUTED Part B (the extraction). Explicit counterexample (VERIFIED, M=3,t=6,q=127):
  F = X^{M-1}P(X^M)+Q(X^M), P=Y^{t-2}+omega_{t-1}Y^{t-3}, Q=const -- a TWO-CHARACTER family.
  * F in K_{I,d}: deg CRT(c_i F mod L_i)=14 <= d=14, G≡c_i F mod L_i for all petals. YES (realizable).
  * squarefree: gcd(F,F')=const. YES.
  * excess c=(t-2)M-1=11 (grows with t).  quotient moment window = 0 (s_M=90=-M*omega_{t-1}!=0).
=> Gate N's pointwise 'window>=c-kappa_N' is FALSE. The N->D->L descent (which needs N's window) is BROKEN.
ROOT CAUSE: quotient compatibility => isotypic mu_M-character decomposition, but does NOT select one character.
The unbounded-excess obstruction lives in MULTI-CHARACTER kernel directions. Same obstruction as
q_cofactor_normal_form (character selection = source data, not a divisibility consequence).
CORRECT REPLACEMENT (Pro): a FAMILY-LEVEL PRK-type statement -- multi-character squarefree-realizable residue
directions are paid separately OR bounded after peeling. NOT a pointwise Newton-window extraction.
IMPLICATION: the petal cluster needs RE-ARCHITECTING around the multi-character obstruction. The stress-first
discipline caught this BEFORE we built a foundation node on the false extraction -- exactly as intended.

## PRK TRUTH STRESS (petal_primitive_residue_kernel_rank) — the AMBER ITSELF is at risk
Question: is PRK's conclusion (dim Pi_prim <= B_pet ABSOLUTE after peeling) even TRUE? Never stress-tested until now.
Measurement (M=3, growing t): dim K_{I,d} ~ c+1 (grows with excess). The MULTI-CHARACTER residual (dim K minus
single largest character block) grows LINEARLY: c=5->4, c=17->12, c=29->20 (~2c/M). Single-character quotient
paid class covers only ~c/M. Pro's two-character counterexamples are squarefree-realizable and grow with c.
=> PRK requires the GROWING multi-character bulk to be PAID by a new mechanism (Pro's 'paid separately') or
   COLLAPSED by Pi_prim. NEITHER established. PRK is NOT confirmed true; its truth = the multi-character
   paid-or-bounded question (same as its proof).
CONSEQUENCE: we cannot separate 'is PRK true' from 'can we prove PRK'. If the multi-character bulk is unpayable,
PRK is FALSE -> the 24 downstream petal->list/mca conditionals need fundamental rethinking. This is now the
decisive petal-branch question. Do NOT invest in re-architecting PRK's proof until its TRUTH is resolved.
LESSON: the amber we were trying to flip had never itself been adversarially tested -- exactly the gap the
user flagged. The gates' refutation was the surface; the amber's truth is the real question.

## PRK FALSIFIED AS STATED (petal_primitive_residue_kernel_rank) — the amber is FALSE with the current paid menu
Attack (Modal, bug-fixed): generic multi-character kernel families (all mu_M-character blocks active, B_r in ker lambda):
- ESCAPE every existing paid class (mu_k quotient/coset, antipodal, cyclotomic; low-defect is single-char-based too)
  -- 25/25 across M=3,5,7, q=127..337, growing c. (First run's q-dependent catches were a z=1 bug in the mu_k
  primitive-root computation -- g could be a k-th power => z=1 => spurious pass. Fixed => uniform escape.)
- dimension GROWS ~ (M-1)c/M with excess c.
=> after peeling the current menu, an UNBOUNDED residual survives => dim Pi_prim <= B_pet (absolute) is FALSE.
   PRK is NOT true as stated.
FIXABILITY (encouraging): the multi-character families are STRUCTURED -- a bounded number (2^M-M-1, c-independent)
of product-of-kernel types. So PRK is likely FIXABLE by adding multi-character paid classes -- but that is a NEW
chargeability obligation (each must fit a ledger budget), which does not exist yet.
ANSWER to 'is the amber true / stress-tested?': NO -- and stress-testing FALSIFIED it as stated. The petal branch
needs an expanded paid menu + multi-character chargeability. The 24 downstream conditionals hinge on this repair.

## CONSUMER-PREMISE ATTACKS (the 5 ambers accepting the 5 reds) — 3 findings, 1 pruning
Per the falsification-pruning protocol, attacked the premises A of the consumer ambers directly:
1. petal_cofactor_chargeability: FALSIFIED AS STATED by the same multi-char families that killed PRK --
   escape paid menu (25/25) AND dim Pi_prim grows ~2c/M (measured 8..24 for c=11..35); tail ops O(1) can't
   rescue. => PRK PRUNED (salvage non-trivial, consumer falls to same object); frontier moved UP to
   chargeability (demoted to red, re-posed). Petal chain trimmed one level toward the prize.
2. dli_prime_block_conductor_mass (+bohr_flatness_prime): INTERFACE MISMATCH -- leaf re-posed to weighted
   average but consumers still sup/uniform-form; plus structural falsifier-candidate (minimal-support profile
   => all singleton blocks => exceptional mass ~L_j, not o(L_j)). Recommend re-posing the T3 intermediate
   chain to weighted form (the second-moment reduction likely needs only the average). No status flip (scope caveat).
3. m720_official_norm_gate_case_manifest_payload: COMPRESSION ROUTE EMPIRICALLY DEAD -- the h=7 (official
   band edge) survivor has FULL degree 32=phi(64), 291*32=9312 >> 250 (fails ~37x); all measured survivors
   full-degree. Live premise narrows to the C2/D-GCD certificate route (data acquisition).
Also: e22 consumer's premise (certificate CF) is exactly what Codex found unachievable (0/85 challengers) --
if Modal-confirmed, the manifest's coverage is vacuous for structured challengers; interface scope must say
which challengers need CF vs are routed elsewhere.

## dli CHAIN RE-POSE + COHERENCE AUDIT (sup -> weighted, full chain) — chain now coherent
- dli_prime_block_conductor_mass + dli_bohr_flatness_prime RE-POSED from sup_M to U-WEIGHTED form
  (E_U[C_j+X_j]=o(L_j); E_U[S_{j,lambda}]=o(L_j) + Markov + trivial eta_j<=L_j => E_U[q^{eta_j}]=q^{o(L_j)}).
  The proved pointwise T3 reduction (S<=C_j+X_j, Deligne + exceptional split) is unchanged, applied inside the average.
- SAFETY MARGIN VERIFIED: low-mass profiles (all-singleton blocks, X_j~L_j) falsify the sup but self-kill under
  the weight: weight fraction 2^{-501L_j} vs penalty q^{L_j}=2^{256L_j} => net 2^{-245L_j}. Independently matches
  Codex's alpha=256 envelope (-0.9639 ~ -245/256) and its exact weighted DPs (rho=1.000000 flat).
- AUDIT UP THE CHAIN: 9 more nodes had per-profile language. Pole/conductor nodes (polar_obstruction,
  pole_majorant, reduced_pole_budget, noncollapse, reduced_phase_manifest, harmonic ledger) are MASS-INSENSITIVE
  (pole orders/conductors don't depend on profile mass) -- left uniform. The 4 mass-SENSITIVE nodes
  (exponential_sum_bound, peak_mass_discrepancy, odd_evaluation_discrepancy, log_integral_equidistribution)
  CANNOT hold for low-mass profiles (inactive coords contribute 0 to the log-integral; the bound needs ~256L_j
  coords x 2log2) -- SCOPED to full-mass profiles; the low-mass tail is absorbed by the weighted ledger below.
=> The dli chain is now COHERENT end-to-end: leaf (weighted/RES) -> ledger (weighted) -> 2nd moment (weighted)
   -> full-mass-scoped Deligne branch -> ejm -> pcf -> b2b (weighted). The re-pose propagation debt from the
   leaf correction is PAID.

## CONFIRMATION ATTACK: dli_prime_block_conductor_mass (weighted) — FIRST VALIDATED FRONTIER
Strategy: of the 5 ambers accepting the reds (rate_half set aside), attack the one most likely to survive
outright, to bank actually-true statements. Ranking: block_conductor (HIGH) > m720 manifest (implication
proved, data-blocked) > sov payload (pricing pending) > e22 manifest (premise failed 0/85) > petal ledger (next domino).
Attack (exhaustive, not sampled): blocks = map-determined dyadic residue classes (the tower partition);
ledger D_lambda = sum_r |A_r||mu_hat_r|^2; swept EVERY lambda != 0 (the uniform-in-lambda quantifier fully
tested), n=32..2048, full-mass profiles.
RESULT — SURVIVED with a strong signal:
  sup_lambda D/coords: 0.296 (n=32) -> 0.0775 (128) -> 0.0149 (1024) -> 0.0048 (2048)  [decaying, sublinear]
  max effective conductor |mu_hat_r|sqrt|A_r|: 2.0-2.7 FLAT across the whole range = O(1)
  (the statement's polylog conductor claim is empirically CONSERVATIVE; reality looks like a constant).
Caveats: L=1 exhaustive at scale (L=2 only at n=32); toy q<=12289; K=2,4 block scales.
=> dli's amber consumer is the first to earn VALIDATED-FRONTIER status under the confirmation protocol.
   The dli branch now has: coherent weighted chain + empirically-nailed leaf obligation + validated consumer.
   It is the healthiest of the five branches.

## BOUNDARY-ARTIFACT HYPOTHESIS REFUTED (petal multi-char falsification is INTERIOR-real)
Question raised by Codex Attempt 9 (0 generic realizable hits, coset chart) + the observation that Pro's
realizable construction sits AT the in-regime boundary d=(t-1)ell-1: is the multi-char falsification a
boundary artifact (=> trivial salvage: handle the boundary row)?
ANSWER: NO, on both counts (full-fibre chart, c_i=a_i^2):
1. Multi-char kernel DIMENSION grows at interior rows too (t=12, d=17 interior: 8; ~2c/3 from mid-interior
   to boundary; only vanishes when the kernel itself is empty at tiny d).
2. Interior realizable MASS exists: t=8, d=11 (boundary=20): 3/400 sampled kernel points are split-squarefree,
   ALL 3 multi-character. ENRICHMENT: random degree-11 polys split at ~1/11!~1e-7; 3/400 means the kernel is
   ~10^4-fold enriched for split points -- the realizable mass is RARE but REAL and structured.
   (0/400 at d>=14 rows is a POWERLESS test, not absence: the boundary rows also show 0/400 despite Pro's
   PROVEN realizable construction there -- random sampling cannot find split polys at degree>=14.)
CAVEAT: the 3 interior witnesses have not yet been run through the paid-class escape checks (boundary
multi-char escapes 25/25; interior expected same, verify before final cut decision).
CONSEQUENCE: the petal falsification is interior-real; the trivial-salvage escape hatch is CLOSED. The petal
frontier converges to Codex's Attempt-9 conclusion: petal_squarefree_classification_ledger_payload is the
live frontier, with the burden = CLASSIFY the rare-but-real structured realizable families (multi-char
included) -- generic mass is absent (Codex, coset chart), structured mass exists (full-fibre, verified).

## BAND CORRECTION (supersedes "boundary-artifact refuted") + enrichment-vs-c outcome + petal compression
CORRECTION: my "interior-real" claim was WRONG -- that test accepted kernel points of LOWER actual degree
(= embeddings of lower rows), not genuine defect-d content. Exact verification (M=3, t=8/10/12): the
exact-degree-d kernel's top coefficient is ALIVE precisely in the TOP-DEFECT BAND d >= M(t-2) (width ell;
Omega-reduction active) and FORCED TO ZERO at all interior rows. Enrichment-vs-c sampling confirmed: zero
exact-degree hits everywhere off-band (the earlier "witnesses" were lower-row embeddings).
=> The multi-char threat at exact defect is BAND-CONFINED. Off-band sparsity gains a proof route (top-coeff
forcing => induction on defect). In-band, at prize-scale q (log_q d! ~ 0), realizable count ~ q^Theta(dim):
the band is the real obligation. SCOPE: full-fibre chart, scalar degree 2 (band = M(t-g) for scalar degree g);
coset charts show zero realizable mass (Codex).
ACTIONS: chargeability (frontier) RE-POSED to the band obligation; sparsity (interface) RE-POSED band-split;
ledger_payload + kernel_classification COMPRESSED into the packet (policy applied; knife stopped at the
verified band line). Petal chain now frontier+interface, matching the dli compression.

## LEAF-CONDITIONAL AUDIT (user-spotted) — 2 hidden reds surfaced + validator invariant added
User spotted CONDITIONAL nodes with no req edges -- impossible under the color contract (conditions must be
wired nodes). Sweep found 3: u1_beta_band_trade_reduction (critical; an OPEN trichotomy claim, census 93/93
but no proof), u1_minimal_fixed_core_sporadic_bound (critical; PROSE-ONLY hypothesis "the no-toral split is
right" = well-posedness meta-uncertainty), plv_reduction (off-critical; amber used as QUARANTINE for an
unreplayed PR claim). ROOT CAUSE: auto_discharge skips zero-req conditionals (guard `if not rk...continue`),
so they sit amber forever, invisible to every audit. ALL 3 demoted to TARGET. VALIDATOR INVARIANT ADDED
(verify_prize_dag.py): CONDITIONAL with no wired req/alt hypotheses is now an ERROR. Critical reds 6 -> 8
(honest count; the u1 pair feed u1_pullback_dichotomy -> mca_grand).

## FRONTIER RETRACTION (fragility response): u1_pullback_dichotomy + petal_growth
Trust in the critical DAG extremities had degraded (3 falsified-as-stated ambers, 2 hidden reds, prose
hypotheses). Applied the new FRONTIER RETRACTION policy: both points demoted to TARGET (honest reds),
9 non-proved dominated nodes cut (archived with manifests), 8 proved dominated nodes kept off the trust
surface. dli deliberately kept in play (leaf+chain+consumer all validated). BOARD: 7 reds -- dli, sov, m720,
e22, rate_half, petal_growth (poly(n) extras uniformly in c), u1_pullback_dichotomy (the compression theorem).
Critical ambers shrink accordingly; the audit surface is now dominated by short, validated chains.
The cut petal band structure + u1 census notes remain the best-known attack routes for the two new reds.

## FRONTIER RETRACTION 3: xr_smallcore_spread_count (user-directed, largest cut)
Retracted at the topmost chokepoint of the midlarge/anchored/sov/m720 lane: 83 dominated (30 non-proved cut
incl. reds sov_gridsum_residual + m720_conductor_compression and the whole spine; 53 proved kept off surface).
New red = the SPREAD remainder count (post-cascade aligned aperiodic supports with pairwise-small cores
<= poly(n)) -- a crisp sunflower/spread obligation. The in-flight SOV-BOHR-PRICING Pro round becomes advisory:
if it lands, RE-EXPAND the segment with proven material (retraction is reversible-by-proving).
BOARD: 6 reds -- dli, e22, rate_half, petal_growth, u1_pullback_dichotomy, xr_smallcore_spread_count.

## FRONTIER RETRACTION 4: worst_word_challenger_pricing (the e22 branch)
Cut the entire e22 sub-frontier (17 non-proved incl. the e22_mixed_petal_covariance red + 16 staircase/
cofactor ambers; 32 proved kept). Most-justified retraction: the branch was built on a premise with QUANTIFIED
failure (CF certificate 0/85 on real challengers; useful premise fails 6527/8393=78% at scale). New red =
the top-down obligation (price/exhaust the structured non-planted challenger class), which ABSORBS the e22
narrowing question in cleaner form; Codex's e22 findings become its attack notes.
END-OF-DAY BOARD: 6 reds (dli validated+in play; petal_growth, u1_pullback, xr_spread_count,
worst_word_challenger_pricing = retraction chokepoints; rate_half aside), 28 critical ambers (was 102).
A complete statement-vs-wiring audit of the remaining ambers is now a feasible single task.

## FULL-LANE COMPRESSION: dli -> x4_exactlist_staircase_split (single arc) + 1 hypothesis SURFACED
User's framing adopted: the chain of ambers IS the conditional proof; the arc = the composed implication,
the packet = the proof document. AUDIT BEFORE COMPRESSION (4 upper links) found the composed proof had TWO
undeclared prose lemmas: (1) u2c clause 3 = "the residual dichotomy conjecture U2-C'" (load-bearing,
unwired); (2) b2_modp's "divisor-frame lemma must close prize scales". U2-C' SUBSUMES (2). Declared as a
new wired red: u2c_giant_tnull_dichotomy (born red; strong scan evidence 39/39, boundary-class-only
survivors; prize scales rest on it). 7 middles compressed; x4 interface hypotheses now: dli frontier +
U2-C' + u1_pullback + proved sides. Two reds (dli, u1) + the new one now VISIBLY converge at x4 -- the
lane's true epistemic shape, previously spread over 9 links.

## RED-LEAF LAW (user catch #6): reds must be logical leaves
User spotted red nodes with predicates -- semantically impossible (red = no proven implication, so nothing
can be its logical hypothesis; if the implication were proved it would be amber). Sweep found 49 req/alt
edges into proof-closure TARGETs/CONJECTUREs across the DAG -- including a red-depends-on-red
(u1_pullback -> xr_smallcore) and a REFUTED alt on petal_growth (the same latent trap as rate_half's gate).
ALL reclassified to 'ev' (evidence/ingredient -- the kind already existed and was used correctly elsewhere).
Deliverable-assembly targets (closure=artifact: dossiers/tables, req = staged ingredient, RIPE-when-green)
are exempt; m4_table tagged artifact. VALIDATOR LAW ADDED: proof-closure TARGET/CONJECTURE with req/alt
in-edges is an error. Board unchanged: 7 reds, 21 ambers, 203 critical nodes (a few proved supporters
dropped off the orbit as intended -- they are evidence, not logic).

## MORNING REPLAY: overnight amber audit (all 21 critical conditionals) — 0 FATAL
Codex's sweep: 9 SOUND / 11 REPAIRABLE / 1 ILL-POSED / 0 FATAL-CANDIDATE. No amber is mathematically broken;
the repairables cluster into SYSTEMATIC issues, all repaired on canonical this morning:
1. FULL-vs-CLEAN RATE SCOPE (6 nodes: mca_grand/safe, both adjacency closings, list_grand, aperiodic_zero):
   full-family claims consumed clean-rate-only premises (rate-1/2 unpriced, VERIFIED: rate_half absent from
   mca_safe reqs). Repair: explicit rate-scope clauses + rate_half wired into mca_safe.
2. EXPONENT MISMATCH (VERIFIED): xr red promised poly(n); consumer sufficiency PROVED exactly at 16n^3.
   Red sharpened to the 16n^3-compatible obligation.
3. strip ILL-POSED -> exact assertion written. x4 packet hypothesis list aligned + missing dli frontier
   statement.md written. f1_case_pole two-predicate packet + f1_classification refresh.
4. Codex's 7 cargo-req->ev reclassifications replayed (verified diamond collapses).
SOUND certificates recorded on 9 nodes (incl. tr_perleaf_list_ident's identification surviving a DIRECT
transport check, and gap1_product_model). The board's ambers are now: audited-sound (9), audited-repaired
(11), re-stated (1) -- the trust surface is fully certified at first-audit level.

## INDEPENDENT STRESS VERIFICATION of all 21 ambers (second audit, 2026-07-06) — 21/21, none falsified
Two-man rule applied: independent of Codex's sweep, every amber's implication (B given A) checked + stressed.
Numerical: exact crossing arithmetic (4 rates), 16n^3-loaded margins (monotone, zero-onset confirmed),
adversarial imgfib fiber census (threshold sharp, fibers <=2 above), strata partition EXACT (sum=B_C every
trial), x4 pullback attack absorbed (primitive=0), worst-word sup won by the CHALLENGER class (pullback 28 >
random 22 -- independently confirms the E15 planted+challenger repair), tr_perleaf transport EXACT (12/12
count equality -- the identification is on the nose), gap1 product bound holds with 10^4x slack.
NEW PRECISION FINDING: rate-1/8 n=2^41 loaded margin = +3.69 bits (tightest row) => the xr spread-count red
has a HARD ~13x ceiling above 16n^3; yesterday's exponent sharpening was quantifiably load-bearing.
Algebraic: f1 trichotomy exhaustiveness forced by the proved forcing+descent pair; bridges = verified import
identities; list side = mirror arithmetic + composition. Ledger: notes/amber_audit_20260706/stress_verification.md.
=> TWO independent audits agree: the conditional structure is SOUND. Open mathematics = exactly the 7 reds.

## GOAL: prove-or-falsify u2c_giant_tnull_dichotomy — OUTCOME: FALSIFIED AS STATED (verified), REPAIRED
- COMPLEMENTATION LEMMA PROVED (sparse full-coset product + Newton; verified 27762/27762 at t=2,3,4):
  S t-null iff complement t-null. Corollaries: top-band rigidity (|S|>=n-t => full coset), (t+1)-support
  rigidity (t-null size t+1 = full mu_{t+1}-coset).
- ACCIDENT HUNT (exhaustive, 7 rows): non-coset t-null sets EXIST exactly where the random model predicts --
  the above-balance window C(n,b) > q^t: (97,32,t=2): 160 at size 6; (73,24,t=2): 168; (17,16,t=2): 128.
  CLEAN at t=3 and at large q/n (window closed).
- VERIFIED GIANT WITNESS: complement of a size-6 accident = 81%-scale 2-null NON-coset block at (97,32,t=2)
  => the unscoped dichotomy is FALSE. RE-POSED with the sub-balance hypothesis q^t >= 2^n (prize-max rows
  qualify by ~2%; the b2_modp scan regime).
- HONEST RE-RANK: the repaired u2c = entropic suppression (zero accidents when expected <1) = the same
  anti-concentration shape as dli's RES count. NOT the easiest red after all; worst_word_challenger_pricing
  moves up to most-tractable.

## CODEX ROUND-2 REPLAY + VALIDATOR-GATE REPAIR (2026-07-06)
Codex round-2 (prize-amber-stress-20260706): batch-1 algebraic attacks all resisted (tr_perleaf 886k comparisons
+ 10/10 negative controls -- stability is load-bearing; moment-trade witness recomputed non-quotient/non-dihedral;
E22 gate UNCLASSIFIED=0); batch-2 existing verifiers all pass. Premise weakenings REPLAYED (6 diamond edges->ev
on list_grand/list_adjacency/r2). CRITICAL CATCHES: (1) rate_half folder carried STALE POSITIVE PROOFS
(conditional.md claimed refuted AQB-I closes the band; proof.md claimed refuted P6 works) -- replaced with honest
open-status + re-posed as the strong full-determination premise; (2) three more statement-less ambers.
GATE REPAIR (found chasing #2): dag_commit's validator gate was a fragile GREP that silently ignored reachability
failures, every invariant added this week, and a NONEXISTENT assembly-verifier step. Now exit-code based; it
immediately caught a red-leaf violation in my own demotion (working as intended). Masked debt paid: 110
retraction-orphaned proved nodes re-anchored as ev on their lane reds (incl. q_cofactor_normal_form).

## CODEX AMBER ROUND-3 INTEGRATED (20 experiment batches, prize-amber-stress worktree)
Highlights: INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATIONS of both of today's red findings -- U2-C boundary transition (192->0
primitive non-boundary blocks as q grows past the window, N=64 t=3 b=8) and the dli weighted repair
(low-mass sup refutations reproduced; weighted form flattens eta 2.33 -> 0.007 with growing active mass).
STRUCTURAL: (1) F1-lane premise weakening (4 diamond edges -> ev; ext_lift's sole logical premise is now the
f1_classification trichotomy); (2) NEW RED u1_x4_direct_column_budget replaces u1_pullback_dichotomy as x4's
premise (strictly weaker: <=n^3 direct-column residue after all strips; probe found no n^3 alarms, positive
controls detected) -- u1_pullback drops OFF the critical orbit (retained as ev/route material); (3) the 3
statement-less ambers got REAL statements from Codex (adopted, superseding my blunt demotion; hypotheses
re-wired). 31/31 verifier suite green in its worktree. Batches 3-15,18,19: GAP-1 telescope algebra, MCA
self-consistency, SPI/Hankel, PMA adversarial (incl. correlated-target search), E22 shuffled-layout census,
TR quotient-row dictionary, XR triangle/quad rank scans -- ALL resisted; no falsifiers.

## DLI-CLOSE PINNED (prong 1 of the closing campaign) — the counterexample-hardened target
Derived + verified the closed form: E_U[rho_j] = q^L Pr[Ad=0] (iid ternary d, P(0)=1/2) = (q^L/2^N)(1+W_j),
W_j = 2^-weight count of ODD-TRADES (disjoint P,Q on the section with matching odd power sums <= 2L-1).
Analytic display: sum_lambda prod_y cos^2(pi a_y(lambda)/q) -- identity VERIFIED exactly (D2=D3=1.347721 at toy).
TARGET: W_j <= 3 per level => prod E <= 2^68, deep inside budget. HARDENING: (i) section hypotheses verified
(no antipodes, no full cosets -- these KILL the antipodal/coset trade families; load-bearing); (ii) window law
calibrated (toy accidents = random counts exactly; gap window-closed at admissible q for all L); (iii) MITM
structure hunts CLEAN at 5 random-empty rows (expected down to 7e-4); (iv) analytic route has a 100% margin
(circle constant -2 bits/coord vs -1 needed). Weight split: w<=L PROVED; gap = the content; tail = K x random
OR the analytic margin. Level-independence flagged as explicit hypothesis. Next: Pro brief + Codex adversarial
goal generated from DLI_CLOSE_PINNED.md.

## SOV-BOHR-PRICING Pro response VERIFIED + banked as the lane's stability theorem
Pro reframed pricing as scale-adaptive containment (fixed B* gate rejected -- right call) and isolated ONE
inverse/stability theorem (small V_h + budget density => near-interval after dilation), anchored in DdS-H +
Bajnok-Edwards (formulas + full calibration table verified to every digit; DdS-H attainment exact). All three
named risk families tested: rank-2 at budget size FILLS; small rank-2 density-excluded; sparse-long-container
FILLS (exact bitset DP 0.882p -- my sampled 0.289p was a CLT-concentration estimator bug, caught; trap recorded).
Advisory on xr_smallcore_spread_count; re-expansion of the retracted sov segment awaits a proof.

## GOAL: prove-or-falsify worst_word_challenger_pricing — OUTCOME: exhaustion PROVED, pricing law verified
Falsification campaign FAILED comprehensively (= survival evidence): open-window cells (sigma=2, q=17),
generic-background receivers, multiple q -- every non-planted list word touches >=2 petals (my apparent
'third class' was a labeling artifact: bg-touching words all also touch >=2 petals; 13/13 reclassify as mixed).
PROVED: Lemma A -- in max-fill cells (bg<=1), NO third class at any sigma>=1, any q (one-paragraph agreement-
counting proof: one-petal g agrees with the planted f_j at >= k points => g = f_j). Hypothesis SHARP: bg=5/9
cells exhibit verified BG-ONLY (the zero polynomial) and ONE-PETAL witnesses. This converts the 296-cell
UNCLASSIFIED=0 census record from observation to theorem.
VERIFIED PRICING LAW (third instance of the universal window law): challengers = codim-sigma coincidences;
count ~ K_cell/q^sigma (count*q ~ 2000 stable across q=97..449 at sigma=1; sigma=2 window opens at q=17 with
7 challengers -- all still >=2-petal -- and closes by q=97). Node kernel reduced to: per-official-row certified
envelope + a K_cell upper-bound lemma. ALSO: caught two of my own artifacts en route (collinear background
manufacturing agreements; labeling-vs-taxonomy confusion) -- both recorded.

## DLI-CLOSE ROUND 2: Pro refutation verified, target re-posed to the row-uniform E-form
Pro refuted W<=3 as stated (verified: 110 relation-trades 1+zeta^95=zeta^146 at q=65537, all in-section;
identity forces W >= 2^240 there). Verification went further: (a) Pro's corrected uniform DLI-AC leaf is
ITSELF false at toys (sup T exceeds the uniform bound 117x -- near-peak concentration); (b) the W-display was
the wrong normalization: at low-q rows W is balanced mass, not trades (the 110 trades contribute 2^-236 to E).
RE-POSED TARGET: E_U[rho_j] <= 4 per level (sum_{lambda!=0} T <= 3) -- row-uniform, endpoint-exact, needs no
top-prime condition, and HOLDS AT PRO'S OWN COUNTEREXAMPLE ROW with E = 1.000000 (exhaustive, sup T = 7e-155).
Round-3 kernel: near-peak mass in SUM form. Pattern (3rd time): uniform quantifiers die, averages survive.

## CODEX DLI GAP-ATTACK (paused run) INTEGRATED — six attacks, zero falsifiers, one algebraic kill
Gap hunt: 10 more window-closed rows CLEAN (15 total, n up to 128, q up to 665089). ROTATION FAMILY KILLED
BY PROOF (odd r0 invertible mod 2^s forces trivial rotation) -- pre-emption item 6 closed. Tail constant
K ~ 1 measured (ratios 0.97-1.48 at n=64, counts to 73k; max 4.3 at small open-window rows). Exhaustive
worst-lambda census (912k lambdas) independently confirms the uniform-AC falsification (worst coordinate
-0.34..-0.84 bits, above -1) -- the round-2 sum-form re-pose was correct. Level-independence: no coupling
found, correctly remains the one flagged hypothesis. D2=D3 exact at 3 new rows. All feeds DLI-NPM.
NOTE: the run crashed the machine on local heavy enumerations (Modal unavailable in its shell again);
next Codex run should get Modal on PATH or hard caps on local enumeration sizes.

## DLI-CLOSE ROUND 4: sub-section refutation verified; target scoped to the production row class R*
Pro's witness (97,32,L=2,N=12 initial segment): Sum T = 3.6234 > 3 -- VERIFIED exactly. Our diagnostic:
random 12-subsets fail too (E=4.1/3.6/3.7) => the cause is the ratio (2^12 < 97^2 violates 2^N >= q^L),
not segment structure; the full half-section survives at the same row (E=1.348). FIFTH window-law instance.
Re-scoped: R* = rotated full half-sections with 2^N >= q^L -- exactly the real dyadic tower levels
(a dyadic residue class = rotated full half-section of mu_{n'}). DLI-NPM* verified at every R* row ever
tested. Pro contributed the exact kernel-form equivalent + two counted proof routes (dyadic near-peak
ledger B_j; half-circle census G_j). Round 5 brief out.

## DLI-CLOSE ROUND 5: FIRST GENUINE REFUTATION (engineered prime, verified) — ABSORBED by the endpoint
Pro engineered a prime q=0.528*2^256 dividing a 6-term cyclotomic norm: 512-orbit of weight-6 trades inside
R*, E=4.75>4 -- VERIFIED end-to-end incl. the Pocklington certificate. The per-level uniform constant is
genuinely FALSE. ABSORPTION (verified): the endpoint consumes the cross-level PRODUCT (budget ~122 bits);
Pro's row costs 2.25 bits; the Vandermonde floor makes engineered costs DECAY with depth (L=1: 7 bits max,
L>=12: ~0); even all-34-levels fantasy = 51 bits. SIXTH window-law instance (per-level constant -> aggregate).
RE-POSED: DLI-AGG (Sum_j log2 E_j <= 100/row) with the remaining kernel = the ORBIT-COUNT question (how many
independent low-weight ternary cyclotomic elements can one prime < 2^256 divide -- each extra = ~2^-216
coincidence). Pro's construction VALIDATES the norm-gate as the true mechanism: the only way into R* was
norm-divisibility engineering, exactly what the proved gate prices.

## V13 ADAPTER LAYER IMPORTED (consolidation phase; upstream verified via towards-prize.md 2026-07-01)
8-node cluster bridging to Przemek's current Q/BC/SP program, all-ev wiring (Codex's review, upstream text
verified by me): 3 PROVED adapters (qbcsp interface = first-match taxonomy; base-field normalization guard =
ledger law -- the most valuable safety import, |F|-vs-|B| errors exceed the 3.1-bit upstream margins; finite
adjacent compiler = the endpoint convention, one-paragraph proof matching the F17^32 row); 1 TARGET
(prefix collision ledger -- upstream proof unaudited, quarantine precedent); 3 CONJECTURE (BC=SPI/XR
identification -- held to the tr_perleaf transport-check standard; SP-distinct-residual -- aligns with our
verified moment-trade/round-5 orbit discoveries; the entropy-subfield envelope headline); 1 TEST (deployed
raw edges 0.4678273/0.4678388 + the four adjacent predictions with 3.1-22.2 bit margins, all flagged
pre-audit). BONUS FIX: pinned_row (PROVED) had an EMPTY statement -- written with the exact upstream numbers
(LD 7@506 / 6@507, 6*2^128 < 17^32 < 7*2^128). Deliberately NOT imported as critical: the four deployed
predictions as req children (rate-1/2 deployed-row exact-constant targets; our DAG is broader).

## 2026-07-06 — dli round 6: ORBIT-COUNT census (Modal, 5 configs, ~700 primes)
- MULTIPLIER SHADOWS: one vanisher P spawns ternary multiples m*P (m weight
  2-3 via cancellation); ALL observed per-prime orbit clustering collapses
  under this closure (63361: 10->1, 65921: 10->1, 48449: 13->4, 65537=F4:
  11->5; residuals ordinary Poisson mass at per-prime mu=#orbits/q).
  Self-falsified the naive per-orbit independence before Pro could.
- Post-closure independence: sub-volume configs match Poisson exactly
  (A 0.605/0.630, C 0.460/0.4625); doubles at/below Poisson (A: 26x rarer).
- No dilation-class stacking at any of ~700 primes (max_dil = 1): the
  "two hits in one norm" channel empty.
- Cross-level lift e->2e is an identity (57/57); cov(k32,fresh64)=0.39 is a
  1/q-scaling confound within band, flagged not claimed.
- Ops: first numpy Modal image in this account; sharded 25 inputs x <10s
  after a full-config input mysteriously hit the 60s cap despite 3.8s local
  runtime — shard-by-primes is the pattern to reuse.

## 2026-07-06 — dli round 6 RETURN: Pro's conditional close verified (26/26); OUR printed bound was false
- Pro's reply to DLI-CLOSE-4: C-style conditional close, NO honest budget
  refutation (the engineered two-independent-norms channel stays empty).
- LITERAL CORRECTION (verified, notes/verify_round6_reply.py in the dli node):
  our printed round-5/6 orbit decomposition E_j <= (q^L/2^N)(1+K*2N*2^-(L+1))
  is FALSE as a bound on E_j — E_j >= 1 always (lambda=0 term of our own D3
  display), RHS < 2^-208 at the admissible unbalanced row q=65537, n'=512,
  L=1 (Pocklington, g=3, omega=15028, relation 1+w^95-w^146=0 all replayed).
  Root cause: D2's exact E=(q^L/2^N)(1+W) has the BULK random trade mass in W;
  swapping W for the low-weight ledger while keeping the volume prefactor on
  the "1" dropped the lambda=0 mass. LESSON (window-law family, 8th instance):
  a REDUCTION printed alongside a correct target needs the same falsification
  pass as the target itself — we stress-tested DLI-AGG for five rounds and
  never once evaluated the printed decomposition at an unbalanced row.
- NO NUMERIC DAMAGE: every banked bit figure was already the excess form;
  Pro's S(1)=51.169972398501 equals our round-5 fantasy stack exactly.
- ABSORBED (new working form): B_j=E_j-1 <= R_j + M_j*r_j*2N*2^-(L+1);
  per-generator cap 256L*2^-L (exact sweep verified); CONDITIONAL THEOREM:
  R_L=0, M_L <= M* = 13.2907840779 (exact rational bracket) => DLI-AGG.
  Census headroom: worst post-closure count 5 => 20.3 bits slack.
- Leaf split: M-BOUND (shadow-weighted multiplicity, number theory) +
  R-BOUND (residual near-peak mass = the old (b)+(c) weight-split content,
  now NAMED as a hypothesis rather than silently absorbed).

## 2026-07-06 — dli round 7 evidence: resultant gate + exact M ledger (attacker's side of the M-bound)
- EXACT SHADOW-WEIGHTED M at all ~700 census primes (empirical_M_ledger.py):
  worst anywhere 12.875 (q=21569, SUPER-volume forced regime — within 3% of
  Pro's threshold M*=13.29!); worst sub-volume 7.75. The uniform M-bound MUST
  carry the sub-volume hypothesis; production levels are ~2^216-fold sub-vol.
- E1 prime-first (61 engineered primes): plant found at every one, bonus
  independent orbits 0 vs 35.2 naive-Poisson — norm selection buys the plant
  + its Galois-dilation copies, never a second generator.
- E2/E2b pair-first: ideal norm N((P1,P2)) = 1 at EVERY random independent
  pair (243/243) — generic pair ideals COPRIME; gcd-web at 1000 pairs finds
  3 common-embedding pairs, all at q=97 = the super-volume floor. Zero
  two-orbit pairs anywhere sub-volume. E3 triples: all ideal norms 1, dead.
- The one surviving route to M >= 2 sub-volume: construct a SECOND
  independent short ternary vector in the prime ideal above q — a
  second-minimum event in a covolume-q lattice (DLI-CLOSE-5 ask A1 route 1).
- HONESTY: toy ring Z[zeta_32] is class-number-1; production Z[zeta_512] is
  not — ideal-class alignment flagged as Pro's opening. Naive-uniformity
  caveat: over ~2^250 admissible primes, Poisson tails predict SOME M > M*
  primes exist (unfindable); the theorem needs sieve/exceptional-set form,
  and absence-below-w* at production q is NOT computationally certifiable —
  named in DLI-CLOSE-5 as the hardest remaining object.
- Ops: the resultant-run hang = census trial-division primitive root (fixed
  with Brent rho) + gcd-echelon blowup on ~3% of ideal norms (contained with
  SIGALRM 20s watchdog); don't pipe background runs through tail (buffering).

## 2026-07-06 — dli round 7 RETURN: Pro's B1 verified & conceded, priced at 0.0006 bits; lattice reframe
- Pro fulfilled B1 as posed: q=110849 (n'=64), FOUR multiplier-independent
  weight-5 generators at a sub-volume row — verified by his verifier (PASS)
  and our independent replay 18/18 (own census machinery reproduces the same
  4 orbits; complete exact-Fraction multiplier check, 768 systems in
  Q(zeta_64)). OUR BAR LACKED A RATIO MARGIN: the row sits at volume ratio
  0.99503 (mu = 0.995) — the boundary population.
- Band census (74 admissible primes around the row): Poisson predicts 1.26
  primes with k>=4, observed 2 — one is an UNCLAIMED k=5 row (q=100609)
  stronger than Pro's certificate. The B1 row is generic, not a mechanism.
- EXACT D3 ground truth: E(110849)=1.00040 (0.00058 bits), E(100609)=1.00031,
  E(204353, k=7)=1.0104 (0.0149 bits). The r-dilution works: the whole
  boundary population is aggregate-invisible. INVARIANT: expected ledger
  mass of the weight-w window = C(N,w)*2^(w-N-L-1), q-INDEPENDENT — mu and r
  cannot both be large; only the balanced-row tail (norm coincidences) can
  hurt, which is what the norm-sieve bounds.
- ADDITIVE CLUSTERS (ninth window-law instance, pre-empted by us): vanishers
  at fixed q = ternary points of the ideal lattice I_q; generators at
  multi-orbit primes are additively entangled (508 ternary pair combos at
  110849; 4302 at 204353 incl. one weight-5; Z-rank 9 < 10). Explains the
  census fat tail (k=7 at mu=0.54 ~ 1.7e-6 naive-Poisson — CORRECTION: the
  round-6 summary mislabeled this prime's mu as 1.55) as lattice-cluster
  correlation, not new structure. Counting re-posed in the LATTICE FRAME:
  W_low(q) = weighted ternary-point count of I_q — no closure conventions
  left; multiplier/additive/lift structure all just lattice points.
- Pro's norm-sieve leaf verified (unconditional, cluster-robust first
  moment). DLI-CLOSE-6 out: production instantiation of the (weighted)
  norm-sieve + R-bound; refutation bars at explicit ratio <= 2^-10 or
  r*2N*W_low > 2^13.

## 2026-07-07 — dli SELF-TENNIS S1-S7 (overnight, terminal): node flipped TARGET -> CONDITIONAL
- Seven self-rounds, both chairs, per SELF_TENNIS_GOAL.md. PROVED: A1-PROD
  norm-sieve (L=1 full window w<=55 at density 2^-47.6; coverage table all
  34 levels; wall at L=20 fundamental; w* corrected 68L -> 57.7L);
  moment-transfer lemma (moments = (2s+1)-ary kernel counts, exact);
  DYADIC-K compression (K <= 3.34 => DLI-AGG); dual ultra-top emptiness +
  geometric-family kill (order-forced cosine dead-zone omega^(N-1) = -1/2,
  verified -44 bits at the F5-factor row; F8 factorization locks
  production base-2).
- SELF-REFUTED (corrections pinned in place): the per-lambda analytic
  display (tail 0.21/coord, not 1 — round-3 117x was this); the S3
  "gluing constants" optimism (middle dual scale IS the core); the
  "(disjoint coordinate sets)" level-independence justification (levels
  share cells; moments are what partition).
- Lam-Leung/Conway-Jones transport: EMPTY at n' = 2^s (reduced form
  excludes all char-0 structure — the section design already consumed it).
- TERMINAL STATE: irreducible core = TWO named conjectures, banked as
  TARGET nodes with dossiers: dli_dyadic_k_core (C1; measured K = 1.45 vs
  threshold 3.34; 5 proof approaches + 4 attack families consumed, walls
  documented) and dli_level_factorization (C2; packet-side product lemma
  or Hoelder folding into C1). dli FLIPPED to CONDITIONAL{C1, C2} with the
  implication chain proved. Board: 162/20/7 -> 162/21/8.
- Full dossier: critical/nodes/dli.../S7_STRUCTURE_REPORT.md. Recommend
  DLI-CLOSE-7 to Pro: C1/C2 + the S1 theorem (old A1 ask now subsumed).
