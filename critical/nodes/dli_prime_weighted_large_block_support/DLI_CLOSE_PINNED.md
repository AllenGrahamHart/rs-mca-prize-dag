# DLI-CLOSE: the pinned target (2026-07-06)

The minimal sufficient obligation to close this node, in counterexample-hardened
form. Every hypothesis explicit; every equivalent display verified; every known
falsifier family pre-empted. This document is the source for the Pro brief and
the Codex adversarial goal.

## Setting (all verified structural facts)

- q PRIME (prime-field scoping: extension rows reduce via subfield_trace_paid_gate,
  PROVED; prime q kills subfield/trace trade families). Admissible: q < 2^256,
  q ≡ 1 (mod n), n = 2^s.
- Level j: L = L_j, N = N_j = 256·L seen coordinates. Section
  X = {zeta^i : 0 <= i < n/2} (the square-root section).
- VERIFIED section hypotheses (these kill the structural trade families — they are
  load-bearing, not decorative):
  (S1) X contains NO antipodal pair {x, -x}  [verified; -zeta^i = zeta^{i+n/2} is
       outside the index window] — kills the antipodal trade family (x,-x both +1
       is an odd-trade).
  (S2) X contains NO full mu_M-coset for any M >= 2 [verified; equally-spaced
       points cannot fit in a half-window] — kills the coset trade family (a full
       even-M coset has all odd power sums zero).
  Also killed: scaling trades (c^r = 1 for r=1 forces c=1), Frobenius trades
  (q ≡ 1 mod n makes Frobenius trivial), subfield trades (q prime).

## The obligation — three equivalent displays (identity VERIFIED exactly, D2=D3 to 1e-6)

Let A be the L x N matrix A_{l,y} = x_y^{2l-1} (odd powers of the section points).

- (D1, combinatorial) An ODD-TRADE is a nonzero d in {-1,0,+1}^N with A d = 0 —
  equivalently a pair of disjoint subsets (P,Q) of X with p_r(P) = p_r(Q) for every
  odd r <= 2L-1. Weight w(d) = |P|+|Q|. Define
      W_j = sum over odd-trades of 2^{-w(d)}.
- (D2, probabilistic/closed form) With d iid per coordinate (P(0)=1/2, P(+-1)=1/4
  each — this measure is EXACTLY the U-weighted central ternary/inactive family;
  derivation: sum_S 3^{|S|} rho(S) / sum_S 3^{|S|} telescopes to it):
      E_U[rho_j] = q^L * Pr[A d = 0] = (q^L / 2^N) * (1 + W_j).
- (D3, analytic) E_U[rho_j] = sum_{lambda in F_q^L} prod_{y=1}^{N}
  cos^2(pi * a_y(lambda) / q),  a_y(lambda) = sum_l lambda_l x_y^{2l-1}.
  (lambda = 0 contributes exactly 1; all terms nonnegative.)

## THE TARGET

> **For every level j: W_j <= 3.**  (Equivalently E_U[rho_j] <= (q^L/2^N)·4, or
> D3-excess sum_{lambda != 0} prod cos^2 <= 3·q^L/2^N + 3.)

Sufficiency for the endpoint: prod_j E_U[rho_j] <= (q/2^256)^t · 4^{34} <= 2^68
(the prefactor is <= 1 at admissible q; 34 levels), far inside the q^{o(t)}
budget the compressed packet consumes. EXPLICIT REMAINING HYPOTHESIS (flagged,
not proved here): the central tower measure is a product across levels (levels
use disjoint coordinate sets), so E[prod] = prod E. This is the packet's
framing; it must appear as a stated hypothesis of the closure.

## Proof architecture (weight split), with the evidence per piece

Let w*(q,L) = max{ w : C(N,w)·2^w <= q^L · 2^{-10} } (~68·L at q = 2^{255.9}).

- (a) w <= L: NO trades. **PROVED** (Vandermonde / skew_support_threshold).
- (b) THE GAP, L < w <= w*: claim ZERO trades at admissible rows. This is the
  real content. Evidence: (i) exhaustive + MITM structure hunts at 5 random-empty
  toy rows (expected counts from 6.0 down to 6.8e-4) found ZERO trades;
  (ii) at open-window toy rows (small q), trades appear in EXACTLY the
  random-model count (e.g. (q,n,L)=(97,32,2): expected ~15 at w=5, found; L=3
  expected 0.56, found 0) — the same window law verified for u2c, with no
  structural surplus anywhere.
- (c) THE TAIL, w > w*: need the true weight-w trade count N_w <= K · C(N,w) 2^w q^{-L}
  (K absolute). Then sum_{w>w*} N_w 2^{-w} <= K · 2^N q^{-L} <= K at admissible q.
  ALTERNATIVE (analytic route subsuming (b)+(c)): via D3, it suffices that for
  every lambda != 0, sum_y log2 cos^2(pi a_y(lambda)/q) <= -(256+delta)·L + O(log q):
  the circle average of log2 cos^2 is EXACTLY -2 (the proved
  dli_circle_log_integral_constant), so the typical value is -2·256·L — the
  requirement is HALF of typical: a 100% (one-bit-per-coordinate) margin.

## Counterexample pre-emption record (what Pro will try, and why it fails)

1. Antipodal / coset / scaling / Frobenius / subfield trade families: killed by
   (S1), (S2), c=1, Frobenius-trivial, q prime — all verified above.
2. Low-mass profiles: integrated into the measure (the closed form IS the
   weighted average); the old sup-form killer contributes 2^{-245L} (verified).
3. Small-q accidents (the u2c pattern): the window law is calibrated — accidents
   exist iff C(N,w)2^w >= q^L, impossible in the gap at admissible q. The
   statement carries the admissible-row hypothesis explicitly.
4. lambda = 0 / d = 0 atoms: excluded explicitly in every display.
5. L = 1,2 small levels: the gap is window-closed at admissible q for ALL L >= 1
   (C(512,5)·2^5 ~ 2^50 << q^2); the toy L=2 accidents are small-q artifacts.
6. Rotation-engineered trades (P with single surviving odd moment, Q = zeta^{2k}P):
   requires zeta^{2k r0} = 1 with the section-disjointness constraints; hunted in
   the MITM census (would appear at w ~ 4L) — none found. Flagged for Codex to
   attack specifically.

## Failure conversion

If (b) fails — a structured gap family exists — the node re-poses with that
family priced (the u2c playbook). If (c)'s constant K is unprovable, the node
re-poses as the explicit conditional "K-bounded tail". Either outcome is a
compression of the red to a strictly smaller kernel; the target above is the
full closure.

# ROUND-2 UPDATE (2026-07-06, after the Pro DLI-CLOSE response — all claims verified)

## What Pro found (VERIFIED)
1. REFUTATION of "W <= 3" as literally stated: the identity forces W >= (2^256/q)^L - 1,
   so the target needs q >= 2^{256-2/L}; explicit witness at (q,n,L)=(65537,512,1):
   zeta=15028, the relation 1 + zeta^95 = zeta^146 gives 110 in-section weight-3
   odd-trades, W >= 13.75. VERIFIED end-to-end (order, relation, section, trades).
2. A corrected conditional close: top-prime condition Delta(q,L) = 4(q/2^256)^L - 1 > 0
   plus the uniform per-frequency bound DLI-AC: T(lambda) <= Delta/(q^L-1) for all
   lambda != 0 implies W <= 3. Algebra VERIFIED exact.

## What verification found BEYOND Pro's note
3. Pro's uniform DLI-AC is itself FALSE at toy rows: at the matched top-of-range toy
   (q=257, n=32, L=2, N=16), sup T(lambda) = 5.3e-3 exceeds Delta/(q^L-1) = 4.6e-5 by
   ~117x (near-peak frequencies concentrate). Only the SUMMED form survives.
4. THE NORMALIZATION FIX (supersedes the top-prime patch): the W-display is not
   row-uniform — at low-q rows the huge W is BALANCED mass (E ~ 1 forces W ~ 2^N/q^L),
   not trades (Pro's 110 trades contribute ~2^-236 to E). The row-uniform object the
   endpoint consumes is E itself:
       >>> RE-POSED TARGET: E_U[rho_j] <= 4 per level  (<=> sum_{lambda!=0} T(lambda) <= 3) <<<
   This needs NO top-prime condition, gives prod_j E <= 4^34 at every admissible row,
   and SURVIVES Pro's own counterexample row: E = 1.000000 there (computed exhaustively,
   sup T = 7e-155). Verified at three row types: Pro's low-q row (1.000000), the
   matched top-of-range toy (1.75), the original DPs (1.0000008).

## The remaining kernel (round-3 leaf)
    sum_{lambda != 0} prod_{y=1}^{N} cos^2(pi a_y(lambda)/q)  <=  3   per level,
i.e. NEAR-PEAK MASS CONTROL IN SUM FORM (the uniform per-lambda form is false; the
dyadic route: #\{lambda : T(lambda) >= 2^{-j}\} counted against 2^{-j}). The exhaustive-
lambda ledger sweeps (n=32..2048, worst-case decay, O(1) conductors) bear directly on it.

## The tennis scoreboard (each round: uniform dies, average survives)
round 1: sup over profiles  -> U-weighted average   (low-mass profiles)
round 2: W-display (row-nonuniform) -> E-display    (low-q balanced mass)
round 3: uniform per-lambda -> summed over lambda   (near-peak concentration)
The E-form target is now triply battle-tested; every known falsifier family is priced
into the display itself.

# ROUND-4 UPDATE (2026-07-06, Pro's DLI-NPM refutation — verified + diagnosed)

Pro refuted DLI-NPM as written with an exact witness: (q,n,L,N)=(97,32,2,12), the
12-point INITIAL SEGMENT of the 16-point half-section: Sum T = 3.6234 > 3 (exact
rational ledger, 3^12 enumeration — VERIFIED). Pro's own scope note: the FULL
half-section at the same row gives small mass (VERIFIED: E = 1.3477, matching our
original identity computation).

DIAGNOSTIC (ours): random 12-subsets ALSO fail (E = 4.1, 3.6, 3.7) — the failure
is NOT segment structure but the coordinates-per-constraint ratio: N=12, L=2,
q=97 violates 2^N >= q^L (4096 < 9409). THE WINDOW LAW, FIFTH INSTANCE.

## ROUND-4 SCOPED TARGET (the production row class, finally pinned)
Row class R*: X = c * (full half-section of mu_{n'}), N = n'/2, with
    2^N >= q^L    (balanced-volume / matched-alpha; automatic at production:
                   N = 256L and q < 2^256).
The real tower levels ARE in R*: a dyadic residue class of the big section equals
a rotated full half-section of mu_{n'} (n' = n/m), and kernels are rotation-
invariant (Sum d_i (c x_i)^r = c^r Sum d_i x_i^r).

>>> TARGET (DLI-NPM*): for every row in R*: Sum_{lambda != 0} T(lambda) <= 3. <<<

Equivalent kernel form (Pro round 4, exact): W <= 4 * 2^N/q^L - 1 on R*.
Verified at every R* row tested: (97,32,16): 0.348; (257,32,16): 0.751;
(65537,512,256): 0.000000; original DPs ~1e-6. Every failure ever produced
violates the R* membership (round-2: low-q with N=256 fixed -> W-display artifact;
round-4: N below the volume line).

## Suggested proof routes (Pro round 4, both summed/counted — guardrail-compliant)
- Dyadic near-peak ledger: B_j = {lambda != 0 : j <= -log2 T < j+1};
  leaf: Sum_j 2^{-j} |B_j| <= 3.
- Half-circle counted form: G_j = {lambda != 0 : #{y : ||a_y/q|| > 1/4} <= j};
  T >= 2^{-j} => lambda in G_j; leaf: Sum_{j>=1} 2^{-j} |G_j| <= 3.

## Tennis scoreboard (5 window-law instances now)
r1 sup-profiles -> weighted | r2 W-display -> E-display | r3 uniform-lambda -> sum
r4 unpinned N -> the R* row class (2^N >= q^L, full half-sections).
The object has survived every round; only the written slack keeps dying.

# ROUND-5 UPDATE (2026-07-06): FIRST GENUINE REFUTATION — and its absorption

Pro refuted DLI-NPM* INSIDE R* (verified end-to-end, incl. the Pocklington
primality certificate): an ENGINEERED prime q = 0.528*2^256 chosen to divide the
norm of the 6-term cyclotomic element 1 - z^33 + z^40 - z^136 - z^143 + z^145
(z of order 512). The 512 folded signed shifts are distinct weight-6 kernel
vectors: W >= 8 > 6.57 (the row threshold), E >= 4.753 > 4. Full half-section,
volume satisfied, no scoping escape. **The per-level uniform constant is FALSE.**

## The absorption (verified arithmetic)
The endpoint (b2b <= 2^122) consumes PROD_j E_j, not per-level constants. One
engineered relation orbit at level L costs E <= (vol)(1 + 512L*2^-(L+1)) — the
Vandermonde floor w >= L+1 makes the cost DECAY with depth:
  L=1: <= 129 (7.0 bits), L=5: <= 41 (5.4 bits), L=12: <= 1.75, L>=20: ~1.
- Pro's actual row: 2.25 bits at one L=1 level. Endpoint margin: untouched.
- Fantasy worst case (ALL 34 levels engineered simultaneously — each extra level
  is an independent ~2^-216 norm-divisibility coincidence): 51.2 bits total,
  71 bits of budget to spare.
SIXTH window-law instance: per-level uniform constant -> cross-level aggregate.

## ROUND-5 RE-POSED TARGET (DLI-AGG — the endpoint's actual consumption)
> For every admissible row: SUM_j log2 E_U[rho_j] <= 100.
Orbit decomposition: E_j <= (q^L/2^N)(1 + K_j * 2N * 2^-(L_j+1)) where K_j = the
number of minimal-weight relation ORBITS at level j whose defining ternary
element has q-divisible evaluation.
**[CORRECTION, ROUND 6: this displayed inequality is FALSE as a bound on E_j
itself — E_j >= 1 always (lambda=0 term of D3), while the RHS is < 1 at
unbalanced admissible rows (2^N >> q^L). Verified counterexample and the
corrected EXCESS form E_j - 1 <= R_j + M_j r_j 2N 2^-(L+1) in § ROUND-6
RETURN below. No numeric damage: all banked bit-arithmetic was already the
excess form.]**
The remaining kernel is the ORBIT-COUNT:
> K_j(q) is small (O(1) engineered + random-window mass) for every admissible q.
Sharp sub-question (clean number theory): how many INDEPENDENT low-weight ternary
cyclotomic elements can a single prime q < 2^256 divide? Each additional orbit
beyond the first is an independent ~2^-216 coincidence; stacking is doubly
unlikely — but this must become a theorem or a per-row certificate.

## Strategic note
Pro's construction VALIDATES the norm-gate as the true mechanism: the ONLY way
into R* was norm-divisibility engineering — precisely what bounded_coeff_norm_gate
(PROVED) prices. The battlefield was correctly identified in round 1; five rounds
of tennis eliminated every other surface. What remains: count the norms one prime
can hit.

# ROUND-6 DISPATCH (2026-07-06): the ORBIT-COUNT census + DLI-CLOSE-4

Evidence run (Modal, 25 sharded inputs, gates PASS — see
notes/ORBIT_CENSUS_SUMMARY.md + notes/orbit_census_results.json):

1. **Multiplier shadows found and priced BEFORE Pro could weaponize them**:
   one vanisher spawns ternary multiples m*P (m weight 2-3, cancellation);
   all observed heavy tails collapse under this closure (13->4, 10->1,
   11->5 incl. q = 65537 = F4). The naive per-orbit independence convention
   is FALSE; the kernel is re-posed modulo multiplier generation + level
   lifts (lifts verified identities, 57/57).
2. After closure: per-prime independent-generator counts Poisson-consistent
   in every sub-volume config (A: 0.605 vs 0.630; C: 0.460 vs 0.4625);
   doubles AT OR BELOW Poisson (A: 26x rarer). No dilation-class stacking
   at any of ~700 primes.
3. DLI-CLOSE-4 dispatched (PRO_DLI_CLOSE_4.md): prove the multiplier-closed
   orbit-count bound (three routes suggested: sieve, Conway-Jones/Lam-Leung
   mod p, per-row certificate) OR refute by engineering one admissible
   prime dividing TWO multiplier-independent norms (our arithmetic: a
   ~2^-216-density coincidence that cannot be selected for under the field
   cap — this is the round-6 battlefield).

Seventh window-law instance pre-empted: per-orbit independence -> orbit
independence modulo the deterministic shadow.

# ROUND-6 RETURN (2026-07-06): C-STYLE CONDITIONAL CLOSE + a literal correction
# (Pro's reply verified end-to-end — 26/26 checks PASS, notes/verify_round6_reply.py)

Pro did NOT produce the requested B-refutation (no engineered prime dividing
two multiplier-independent norms — that channel stays empty). Instead: a
verified literal correction of OUR printed round-5/round-6 reduction, plus a
corrected conditional close with exact constants.

## The correction (VERIFIED; the error was ours, introduced at the round-5 re-pose)

The printed orbit decomposition E_j <= (q^L/2^N)(1 + K_j·2N·2^-(L+1)) is FALSE
as a bound on E_j: the D3 identity forces E_j >= 1 (lambda = 0 contributes
exactly 1 — stated in OUR OWN D3 display above), while the printed RHS is < 1
at any unbalanced admissible row (2^N >> q^L). Verified counterexample:
q = 65537 (= F4, Pocklington replayed), n' = 512, N = 256, L = 1, pinned
omega = 3^128 = 15028, primitive weight-3 relation 1 + w^95 - w^146 = 0; even
granting K every signed reduced weight-3 element (2^3·C(256,3) = 22,108,160)
the RHS is 185459517751297/2^256 < 2^-208.6 < 1 <= E. Root cause: the D2
identity E = (q^L/2^N)(1 + W) is exact, but W contains the BULK random trade
mass (which is what inflates E back to ~1); replacing W by only the low-weight
orbit ledger while keeping the volume prefactor on the "1" silently discarded
the lambda = 0 mass.

DAMAGE ASSESSMENT — none numeric: every banked bit figure (round-5 row cost
2.25 bits, the decay table, the 51.2-bit fantasy stack) was already computed
in excess form; Pro's S(1) = 51.169972398501 equals our fantasy number
exactly, and no negative-bit credit was ever taken at unbalanced rows. The
printed inequality was the only casualty.

## The corrected conditional close (absorbed as the new working form)

With r_j = q^{L_j}/2^{N_j} <= 1 and B_j := E_j - 1 = sum_{lambda != 0} T_j:

>  (H)  B_j <= R_j + M_j · r_j · 2N_j · 2^-(L_j+1)
>  M_j = SUM over new independent generators g of s_g (shadow-weighted:
>        s_g = 1 + sum over g's multiplier/lift shadow orbits of
>        2^-(w'-L-1) — deterministic, geometric),
>  R_j = residual non-generator near-peak mass after closure.
>  (C)  DLI-AGG follows from  SUM_j log2(1 + R_j + M_j·r_j·2N_j·2^-(L_j+1)) <= 100.

Per-generator cap (verified, exact sweep L <= 34, N <= 20000): r·2N·2^-(L+1)
= r·N·2^-L <= 256L·2^-L whenever q < 2^256, 2^N >= q^L. Hence for the 34-level
production schedule, with S(M) = SUM_{L=1..34} log2(1 + M·256L·2^-L):

  S(1) = 51.170,  S(5) = 79.702,  S(10) = 93.865,  S(13) = 99.516,
  S(M*) = 100 at  M* = 13.290784077959  (exact rational bracket verified),
  S(14) = 101.141.

**Conditional DLI-AGG theorem (Pro, verified): if R_L = 0 and M_L <= M* for
all 34 levels, then SUM_L log2 E_L <= 100.** Census headroom: worst
post-closure independent count anywhere = 5 (uniform M <= 5 leaves 20.3 bits
of slack for shadow-factor inflation and residual mass).

## The remaining leaf, now split into TWO named obligations

1. **M-BOUND (sharpened ORBIT-COUNT):** the shadow-WEIGHTED multiplicity
   M_L <= 13.29 per level — combinatorial/number-theoretic; census evidence
   says worst raw count 5, shadows priced geometrically. This is what
   DLI-CLOSE-5 must pose.
2. **R-BOUND (the old (b)+(c) content, restated):** R_j is exactly the excess
   of the bulk trade mass over its mean-field value (r·W_bulk - (1-r)) — the
   gap-zero + K-bounded-tail work of the weight-split architecture above.
   R_L = 0 is a HYPOTHESIS, not a theorem; the conditional close does not
   discharge it, it names it.

Certificate format agreed (Pro's §5): Pocklington cert, pinned roots/omegas,
new-generator reps at minimal levels, shadow factors s_g, residual cert R_j,
final rational check of (C). Our census machinery is the verifier skeleton.

Files: notes/pro_reply_round6_fulfilment.md (verbatim),
notes/pro_reply_round6_checker.py (Pro's checker, replayed),

# ROUND-7 DISPATCH (2026-07-06): DLI-CLOSE-5 — the M-bound, both sides instrumented

Evidence run before dispatch (notes/RESULTANT_GATE_SUMMARY.md +
notes/empirical_M_ledger.py): exact shadow-weighted M at all ~700 census
primes — worst anywhere 12.875 (super-volume forced regime, 3% under M*!),
worst sub-volume 7.75 ⟹ the uniform bound must carry the SUB-VOLUME
hypothesis. Attacker's side: E1 prime-first engineering never donates a
second generator (0 bonus at 61 engineered primes vs 35.2 naive-Poisson);
E2/E2b generic pair ideals are COPRIME (243/243 norm 1; the only 3
common-embedding pairs in 1000 sit at the super-volume floor q=97);
E3 triples dead. Surviving attack = second short vector in the prime ideal
above q (second-minimum obstruction).

DLI-CLOSE-5 (PRO_DLI_CLOSE_5.md) poses: (A1) the sub-volume M-bound in an
honest form — sieve above explicit size/volume thresholds, or
exceptional-set density, or engineering-hardness (naive full uniformity is
heuristically FALSE by Poisson tails over ~2^250 admissible primes, and
absence-below-w* is not computationally certifiable at production q — both
flagged by US in the brief, eighth window-law instance pre-empted);
(A2) the R-bound via the analytic one-bit-margin route; (B) refutation bars
updated (two independent generators at a SUB-volume prime; effective
M > 13.29 sub-volume; or the full 100-bit budget).
