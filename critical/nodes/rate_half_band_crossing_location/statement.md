# BAND CHILD 2 (RH-AC): locate the adjacent crossing at the razor rows

- **status:** TARGET
- **parent:** `rate_half_band_closure` (req, gate all)
- **created:** 2026-08-09, the user-directed band decomposition
  (notes/band_decomposition_plan_20260809.md); pose adopted from the
  round-27 (RH-AC) draft with the decomposition ratification

## Statement (RH-AC, the pose of record; quantifier WIDENED 2026-08-10)

At every admissible row with n = 2^41, k = 2^40, **q prime,
q = 1 mod n, 2^167 < q < 2^256** — the entire undetermined range;
below 2^167 the crossing is PROVED (the wave-10 staircase), and the
razor slice (2^255.9, 2^256) remains the hard corner — locate the
exact adjacent crossing a_RH(q) of (RH-ADJ):

[QUANTIFIER WIDENING (2026-08-10, coordinator, executing the
ratified tiling intent): the creation pose read "q prime in
(2^255.9, 2^256)" — razor rows only. The round-28 mca_safe_rewire
audit proved the decomposition's children did not tile the parent's
quantifier (rows with q in [2^167, 2^255.9] were located by
nothing — the E7 SCOPE SEAM flag on adjacency_closing). The parent's
consumers quantify over ALL admissible q; the sub-2^167 range is
proved; this child must own the rest. The widening EXPANDS this
node's obligation: the residual-budget interval [2^167, 2^167+2^129)
is exactly the apolar target's territory (budgets {2^39, 2^39+1}),
and (2^167+2^129, 2^255.9] carries the same bracket
[k+2^34, 3n/4 for q >= 2^169, n below] with no located crossing.
The E7 flag is RESOLVED by this widening, same day, recorded on
both nodes.]

```text
B_mca(a_RH) <= B*(q) = floor(q/2^128) < B_mca(a_RH - 1),
a_RH in [k + 2^34, 3n/4]          (the PROVED bracket).
```

The binding term is S_sparse alone — B_ca^far is free at razor rows
(B* ~ 2^128 >> n; the Hankel layer discharges the far-CA half) — so
the open content is exactly

```text
min { a : S_sparse(a) <= floor(q/2^128) }.
```

**No random-word quantity may appear in this statement** (the
round-27 forced correction: FLOOR v2 fell to its own falsifier via
the max-vs-mean type error; its four survivals were zero-power).

Named candidate endpoints — no discriminating evidence held:
- **(RH-AC-lo)**: a_RH = k + 2^34 (the quotient floor is tight);
- **(RH-AC-hi)**: a_RH = 3n/4 (the half-distance pincer HD1 is tight).

The determined-region ratio extrapolation (~2^38.9, near -hi) is a
heuristic across a mechanism change, labelled as such.

## Known structure at creation (round 27, all coordinator-replayed)

- Lower end COUNTING-EXHAUSTED: the next floor rung is 11.87 bits
  short with a provably tight normalizer; the simple-pole conversion
  goes lossless as q grows; no counting argument crosses n/log2 q.
- Upper end GATED by residual budget 2^39+1: diagnosed to the unit
  (one slope past the provable incidence limit; the m=1 fence);
  evidence-grade TRUE on the forced prime-field axis; proof needs
  the APOLAR ORIGIN. Closing it extends the bracket top from
  q >= 2^169 to all q > 2^167.
- Supply flank censused: THEOREM CAP is slack-0-scoped; the
  arbitrary-word maximum's scaling is the one undetermined number
  (named decisive run: the Modal-class n=32 t=1 maxscan).

## Falsifiers (pre-registered, round 27, with power controls)

- **F1** (high power, fires against -lo): push the quotient-remainder
  floor's razor reach beyond 2^34 - 1.
- **F2** (fires against -lo from the safe side): exhibit one received
  word y and razor row with N(y, k+2^34; q) > floor(q/2^128).
- **F3** (ZERO-POWER DECLARATION): any random-word or window-law
  count check at q < 2^128 has no power over this pose — it measures
  the mean object. This guard is load-bearing text.

## Consumer bars (CATCH-24C, round-27 verified)

- `adjacency_closing`: needs the LOCATED crossing (adjacent certified
  indices — the moving bar). The full pose serves it.
- `mca_safe`: needs the safe half AT THE LOCATED INDEX — the SAME
  moving bar, not a weaker one. (ROUND-28 CORRECTION, 2026-08-10:
  the 2026-08-09 reading "a_safe is textually free, so PROVED HD1
  discharges the bar at q >= 2^169" is WITHDRAWN. a_safe is unbound
  in mca_safe's own prose but bound by its consumers — the
  unsafe-side claim of record is stated at a_safe - 1 and mca_grand
  must EXHIBIT the crossing. HD1 is an upper bracket END at 3n/4 and
  B_mca is nonincreasing, so it bounds nothing below 3n/4. Reductio:
  a free a_safe would be discharged unconditionally at a = n by the
  PROVED mca_full_agreement_endpoint (FA1: B_mca(n) = 1), with no
  field floor at all — strictly stronger than HD1 and obviously not
  what the consumer needs. The premise-weakening surgery is RETIRED
  as unsound.)
- `list_adjacency_closing`: no longer consumes this content (owner
  moved at wave 10).
